There are 5 types of buttons on JCU, each of which is suited for specific purposes and contexts. The button text are capitalized and are as short as possible, while clearly explaining what happens when the button is pressed. The button styles below are listed in the order of prominence theyâ€™d normally have in the interface, starting from the most prominent ones.


## Primary button 
Primary buttons are yellow rectangular buttons, which are normally used to represent a primary call to action on a page or a module. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen, although they can be re-used in a page to reinforce an action. Keep in mind that not every screen needs a primary button.
