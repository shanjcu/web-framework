## Colour palette
These are JCU brand colours.

## Primary palette
The primary colour blue is the colour displayed most frequently across the website.  It can be used to separate content, create emphasis, highlight links and headers. To create contrast between elements,  lighter or darker tones of the primary color can be used. The contrast between lighter and darker tones helps show division between surfaces, sections and elements.

## Secondary palette
The secondary colour (yellow) is complementary to the primary color. It should contrast with elements that surround it and be applied sparingly as an accent. It is best used for buttons, sliders, text selection and progress bars.

## Additional palette
There are two colours in the additional colour palette: green and pink. Additional colours are used more sparingly in smaller elements such as focus state, confirmation and error messages.

## Greyscale palette


## Accessibility
Text that appears on coloured backgrounds should be legible and meet accessibility standards. Only these combinations of background and text colour should be used as other combinations may not be compliant. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) level AA requires a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and a 3:1 ratio for large text.
