## Intro
Perceptual patterns shape how a product is perceived and ensure a consistent look and feel across all of JCU’s websites and applications. The objective is to build a strong brand recognition across all of our platforms. 
Examples of perceptual patterns: tone of voice, typography, colour palette, layouts, illustrations and iconography styles, shapes and textures, imagery, animations etc


## Branding
Our brand identity supports the University’s strategic intent of, “A brighter future for life in the tropics, worldwide.” 
The brand personality traits that underpin our visual identity are: outgoing, bright, direct, results-oriented and articulate. 
For the JCU brand this means:
* **Outgoing:** Worldly, adventurous 
* **Bright:** Vibrant, optimistic 
* **Direct:** No-nonsense, down-to-earth 
* **Results-oriented:** Helpful, hands-on, practical, realistic. We get things done 
* **Articulate:** Clear, compelling

Overarching the brand identity is the golden ratio and the Fibonacci spiral, ever-present and inspiring form in nature, serving as a visual metaphor for JCU branding. 

Our brand identity reflects on the perceptual patterns as the following:
* Positive and encouraging tone of voice
* Relevant, informative and contextual (practical, realistic) images
* Flat colours: primarily blue colour palette with yellow accents. Secondary accents are green and pink. 
* Generous white space
* Generally large type size with a focus on readability
* Shapes, spaces, sizes, animations and imagery are based on the golden ratio and Fibonacci proportions
* Mostly square and occasionally triangular shapes and textures.
