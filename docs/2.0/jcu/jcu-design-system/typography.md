## Fonts
JCU uses Lora for headlines and Source Sans Pro for all the other applications. 
Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy and moderate contrast. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly aligns with JCU logo. Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.
Source Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.

## Variants
* Lora: bold, bold italic
* Source Sans Pro: regular, italic, semibold, bold, bold italic
